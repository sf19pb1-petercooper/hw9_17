Forbes,Telecoms Are In A Tricky Spot„Can Tech Save Them?,https://www.forbes.com/sites/intelai/2018/09/21/telecoms-are-in-a-tricky-spotcan-tech-save-them/#70e944007b34,"When telecoms built their infrastructures after the Bell monopoly met its end in 1983, things were a lot simpler. A home or office would have landline phones, eventually adding a PC here and a cellphone there. Then the world changed. Phones got smart, smartphones largely took over, and suddenly the typical citizen of the developed world (and even beyond it) was carrying a powerful little computer in his or her pocket. People began using these devices to do everything: communicate, work, talk, watch movies, play video games and so on. ItÕs the story of our times. And itÕs the story of a massive data traffic jam. Internet data volume in the United States has increased 238 percent in the past two years, an Accenture report shows. By 2021, video will account for 76 percent of all mobile data traffic. ThatÕs the tip of the iceberg. The internet of things (IoT) will add billions of new connections in coming years. In the enterprise market, smart buildings are already transmitting energy information from their HVAC systems, factory machines are spewing out data, and hospitals are using technology to monitor patients and transmit results to professionals in real time. This explosion of traffic places heavy demands on telecommunications companies, which provide the networks that carry all this traffic. Yet telecoms are unable to profit much from it. Customers who watch videos and shop on cellphones use up more network resources, but telecoms continue to charge them a static monthly fee. TheyÕre reluctant to raise prices much amid intense competition. In the meantime, content providers such as Google, Amazon and Facebook are using telecomsÕ networks to make megabucks. SomethingÕs got to give if telecoms are to grow their revenues and serve rapidly expanding customer needs. With the right investments, telecoms can grow their business by giving customers better solutions while reducing their own costs. Here are three crucial technologies that will help them do just that. Sending Capacity To Where ItÕs Needed Most 5G, the fifth generation of wireless technology, gives carriers an unprecedented opportunity to expand and improve their services. Operating at speeds 10 to 20 times faster than todayÕs networks, 5G transmits far more data and increases responsiveness, doing much to eliminate the internet traffic jam. But 5G does more than that. 5G also changes the architecture of the network, transforming it from a simple pipe to an intelligent hub that allows telecoms to use their capacity more efficiently and serve customers better. Communication networks are laid out based on anticipated demand, with only so much carrying capacity provided to each area. But customer usage may change, creating bottlenecks. One area may become jammed, while another has excess capacity. With 5G, telecoms can shift capacity from an area where itÕs not being used and add it to a different location where lines are filling up. The network becomes a smart, holistic system capable of responding to demand when and where itÕs needed. Say a football team wants to offer fast, reliable cellular service to its fans. For the telecom provider, that means scaling from zero connections to 60,000 in a short time as spectators fill their seats. 5G infrastructure enables them to do that by tapping in to capacity from nearby towers as needed. 5G can do the same for a manufacturer or a hospital, guaranteeing that service wonÕt fail in times of critical need. In addition to shifting connection capacity, telecoms can allocate storage and compute power among networks as needed. In the football stadium, thousands of fans will be snapping and uploading images throughout the game. The carrier can handle this demand by dedicating increased storage capacity to that area. To improve speed, it can add compute power, perhaps allocating 18 of its data servers to the stadium instead of the normal two. Boosting Speed On The Leading Edge Another transformational technology telecoms can offer their customers is edge computing. Instead of sending information to a data center that may be hundreds of miles away, carriers can use flexible cloud servers located much closer to clients, improving transmission speed and latency. That lets cities broadcast the latest information about incidents and traffic to police and emergency service providers, making sure theyÕre always up to date. Using edge computing tech, they can send hyper-localized traffic information to drivers, helping them make better decisions about which route to take. Edge computing lets enterprises offer applications that run faster and have better response times, whether their customers are watching videos or applying for new credit cards. The low latency of edge computing will become even more important as artificial intelligence (AI) and the IoT gain traction. In factories, processing data locally allows machines and robots to respond to problems quickly, before they produce whole batches of damaged goods. And thatÕs just one of the many use cases of edge computing. By 2020, 65 percent of enterprises will adopt IoT products, according to Gartner. As 21 billion new IoT devices come online in the next couple of years, telecom networks will need to harness the power of AI themselves to manage them. Applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to network operations gives telecoms a smarter way of planning and distributing their capacity. TheyÕre using these techniques to some extent today, and as they gather more data, AI will guide them to ever more efficient ways of optimizing their services. The Benefits Of Smarter Enterprise Connections In todayÕs world of global connectivity, businesses must be flexible. Many companies have branches spread out around the worldÑor produce goods for the world market. ÒA pharmacy or a bank may have 10,000 offices globally, and every one needs an equipment box and proprietary protocols to connect,Ó said Amol Phadke, managing director for global network transformation for Accenture. To make life easier for clients and themselves, telecoms are embracing the software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN), a technology that allows businesses to manage multiple types of connections from a single interface. SD-WAN networks are much simpler to implement and upgrade than traditional business networks. Software-defined systems are so easy to install that companies can do it themselves. That means telecoms donÕt have to send salespeople and technicians around the world. Instead, they can sell the boxes on the internet. ÒAn enterprise CIO can go online and say, ÔI want to open 10 sites in Manila; please ship me boxes X, Y, Z and IÕll sign up for your serviceÑdone,ÕÓ Phadke said. SD-WANs also make it easier for customers to upgrade their networks to improve performance and security. ÒThey can go to the open-source community and have someone build and test something and get it out the door in months,Ó said Joe Wojtal, vice president of open systems and solutions at systems integrator World Wide Technology. By using less expensive equipment and selling on the internet, telecoms serve customers better while reducing operating costs. ÒThey can save billions of dollars a year by moving to a new model,Ó Wojtal said. Telecoms today are in a tight spot, with flat revenues, demanding customers and content companies that use their services without contributing to the bottom line. But by deploying 5G, edge computing, AI and software-defined connectivity, they can turn things around, transforming their networks to provide faster, smarter, more efficient service to a rapidly expanding base of customers.

It makes mistakes no human would make, such as when a photo app confuses a skier with a mountain. It also beats world champions at complex games, solves biochemistryÕs greatest challenges, writes prose so humanlike that the creators of the program have deemed it unsafe to release in full, and promises cars that can drive without a human at the wheel by next year. These are not easy feats, and yet theyÕre happening: AI is being applied to big data to solve some of the greatest research challenges of our time. In this piece, we examine these recent breakthroughs and their implications for their fields and for the world. A Near-Human Text Generator Anyone who has spoken to their mobile phone assistant or the home device on their kitchen counter has had the experience of being misunderstood: The program plays the wrong song, proposes the wrong restaurant or offers an answer so random that everyone gets a good laugh. Auto-completion of texting is far from perfect, and machine translations of sentences from one language to another still confuse homonymsÑsuch as swapping the word Òfan,Ó the cooling appliance, for Òfan,Ó a devotee. Learn more about how companies are leveraging AI today. Natural language processing (NLP) is an AI subfield concerned with the ability of computers to understand human speech. Achieving accuracy in NLP is an extremely difficult task given the subtle complexities of human communication. NLP has yet to achieve a deep, semantic understanding of context, of the essence of a written scene in a play or of the theme of a novel. Or has it? OpenAI is an AI research Òcapped-profitÓ company based in San Francisco. Its goal is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity, and it seeks to achieve this by building safe AGI. GPT-2, an AI-powered text generator built by one of the companyÕs research teams, recently proved so powerful that its creators considered it too dangerous to release in full. OpenAI originally created GPT-2 with one simple goal: to predict the next word in a sequence, given all the words that came before it. Researchers trained GPT-2 on a dataset of 8 million webpages. In response to prompts, GPT-2 produced unexpectedly coherent responses. A sample is included here: Human-generated prompt: In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote, previously unexplored valley, in the Andes Mountains. Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect English. Excerpt of the machine-written completion (10 tries): The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, OvidÕs Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science. Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved. Dr. Jorge PŽrez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. PŽrez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snowÉ GPT-2Õs language isnÕt perfect, but it is surprisingly cogent and close to human-quality. GPT-2 has generated many other works, including a counterintuitive essay on why recycling is bad for the world that David Luan, VP of engineering, says could earn a Ògood scoreÓ were it to be submitted as part of the SAT. At a demonstration of GPT-2 this month at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), we fed the model two sentences from the point of view of a person who worked in AI and investment, was also a writer and was Òtrying to figure out some job transitions.Ó In response, GPT-2 generated lucid sentences in the voice of an aspiring novelist trying to find an agent and doubting her ideas. What are the implications of such success? OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever contends that a model that Òpredicts the next word in text sufficiently well will lead to understanding of the text.Ó If a computer algorithm can generate sentences that are nearly indistinguishable from a humanÕs, in other words, we may have more than just an excellent language model. We may have even achieved that elusive deep semantic understanding. Of course, we canÕt say for certain whether GPT-2 is merely mimicking human writing based on the webpages it has surveyed. The sample we generated at ICLR reflects a common writerÕs dilemma described in many a writerÕs blog. Some GPT-2 language samples are more cogent than others, and there is likely a bit of selection bias when it comes to which ones OpenAI chooses to publish on its public blogs. Nevertheless, GPT-2 is still a fundamental step toward a powerful language model: one that can be used for every NLP application, from summarizing legal documents, to auto-generating medical reports, to reading a userÕs digital footprint for financial services, to creating customer-service bots attuned to human emotionÑand we have just begun to scratch the surface. AI Is Solving A Grand Challenge In Biomedical Research The Òprotein folding problemÓ has long challenged researchers. It is concerned with accurately predicting how an amino acid sequence determines the 3D structure of a protein. This structure governs a proteinÕs ability to perform its functions. Dysfunctions in folding can cause, in some cases, allergies or diseases such as AlzheimerÕs, ParkinsonÕs and cystic fibrosis. The possible shapes that a string of thousands of amino acids can take is far beyond the capacity of even the most powerful computers to model. While researchers have devoted significant effort to addressing the protein folding problem, it has remained unsolved for the past 40 years. Enter the power of deep learning. Google DeepMind trained a neural network on a dataset of 30,000 known protein structures to develop AlphaFold. AlphaFold can predict the 3D shapes of protein structures with much more accuracy than previously possible. In a December competition, AlphaFold beat out 98 entrants, predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins and catapulting ahead of the second-place team, which predicted the structures for only three. ÒIÕve been talking about applying AI to science for a long time,Ó said Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, in a recent talk at the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines. ÒBut this is really our first proof of concept that this really could work, and in a really important area of science that will have a lot of impact.Ó Solving the protein folding problem is a key priority for DeepMind. If scientists can understand protein folding, they can better predict harm, improve drugs and design synthetic proteins to fight diseasesÑor even perform other functions such as breaking down environmental pollutants. While much more research remains to be done, AlphaFold is a critical breakthrough that lays a foundation for future ones. AI Has Mastered Games More Complex Than The Real World Researchers have long used strategy games to test and challenge computers, with systems defeating human champions at games such as chess (Deep Blue, 1996), ÒJeopardyÓ (Watson, 2011) and Go (AlphaGo, 2017). These accomplishments reverberated beyond their industries and made these systems household names. AI researchers have continued to take on games of increasing complexity, involving multi-player interactions among characters with distinct abilities, navigating real-world environments. In December, DeepMindÕs program AlphaStar defeated a top professional player in ÒStarCraft II,Ó a complex and dynamic real-time strategy game long considered a grand research challenge for AI. In April, OpenAI Five, a team of five neural networks, defeated the reigning world champions in the esports game ÒDota 2,Ó which involves five-on-five real-time interaction. AlphaStar and OpenAI Five achieved these wins using reinforcement learning (RL), an area of machine learning in which algorithms take action based on rewards and punishments. RL is a growing subfield and arguably a more natural way to solve problems for human systems than other forms of machine learning. Such successes may make teaching computers to win games seem easy, but the job is in fact extremely difficult. In 10 years of continuous training, OpenAI Five has played 45,000 years of ÒDotaÓ against itself. Mastering games like ÒStarCraftÓ and ÒDota 2Ó involves numerous AI research challenges, including in the realms of game theory and decision-making. These breakthroughs have important implications for the real world. AlphaStarÕs ability to make complex predictions over a very long series of possible steps, with only imperfect information, could be used to predict the weather or understand language. Training in the virtual gaming world helps to perfect robotic behavior in the real one: Despite the challenges of building accurate simulated worlds, OpenAIÕs robot has notably been able to adapt quickly from its simulated environment to reality. Many real-world questions, such as those involving business strategies and financial trading, are arguably simpler than those posed by ÒDota 2.Ó RL that can understand these rich and complex environments and execute better than humans is both extremely valuableÑand a cautionary tale. It is vital that these incredibly powerful tools be released in a safe and ethical manner that ensures their impact is only for good. A Fleet Of Data Collectors Elon Musk claims that Tesla will achieve fully autonomous driving capabilities by next year. To accomplish what is one of the most interesting AI moonshots of our time, Tesla is breaking with the rest of the autonomous driving industry in several ways. First, unlike Ford, Uber and Waymo, among others, Tesla is opting out of the use of expensive LiDAR sensing technology to rely instead on its own computer vision technology and AI, using cameras, radar, GPS and other sensors. Whether Tesla stays this course remains to be seen. Second, and relatedly, Tesla has built its own AI chip, optimized for self-driving. Tesla claims its chip is cheaper, more efficient and faster than what it could buy off the shelf. Media coverage has focused on dissecting TeslaÕs claims about its processing power and the advantage that gives it. But the more interesting implication is how this chip highlights TeslaÕs underlying data-driven strategy. While competitors are training self-driving cars using beta testers or elaborately created simulators, Tesla has cleverly launched itself ahead of the pack. With their eight cameras, as well as radars and ultrasonics, hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles on the roads are sensing and gathering real-world data about traffic conditions, weather and obstacles. Such information is particularly valuable for capturing corner cases that a virtual simulator may not anticipate, such as unusual debris, vandalism or irrational animal or human-driver behavior. Drawing from this enormous database, Tesla engineers can batch instances of these rare edge cases to train and refine their system. Thus, in an AI world where data are a competitive advantage and companies fight to find cheaper sources, Tesla has pulled off a coup. ItÕs created an entire fleet of collectors: Tesla drivers who, simply by driving day by day, are gathering an unprecedentedly rich collection of driving information.Even better for Tesla, its drivers are paying for the privilege
As for TeslaÕs claim that it will have fully autonomous cars by next yearÑit certainly has a good head start.These recent breakthroughsÑin language processing, scientific research and computer vision and in how agents navigate complex environments that cannot be observed in fullÑare not baby steps. They represent material advances in the field and are evidence of the rapid rate at which AI is progressing. They will make us more efficient, change the way we do business and make robotics possible in ways we have yet to imagine. We look forward to seeing these new applications and systems, and weÕre fastening our seat belts.Because the journey has just begun."
MRO Network,Blockchain Tipped For Leasing Impact,https://www.mro-network.com/technology/blockchain-tipped-leasing-impact,"Blockchain Tipped For Leasing Impact Blockchain expected to be advantageous to the leasing industry in areas such as records management Ð but lessors have called for greater collaboration and Blockchain Tipped For Leasing Impact Blockchain expected to be advantageous to the leasing industry in areas such as records management Ð but lessors have called for greater collaboration and participation around the technology. James Pozzi | Nov 14, 2018 Characterized as a shared ledger offering users a complete, time-stamped record of transactions and processes within it, blockchain has been tipped by many in the industry to make a tangible impact in the near future. Among these are professional services company Accenture, which for two years' running, has cited blockchain as one of its emerging technologies and says adoption is accelerating at a quicker pace than anticipated. A research report published by the company earlier this year looking at 18 different industry sub segments showed 86% of aerospace and defense companies expect to integrate blockchain technology into their corporate systems by 2021. The technology has also garnered the attention of the leasing industry, which places a heavy onus on parts traceability and digital records management. Liam Creaven, SVP greater China and Asia at industry giant GECAS, says the company is open towards the implementation of blockchain technologies. To date for its records transfer, GECAS has used systems such as AerDataÕs STREAM offering. ÒIf everybody was using blockchain then it would be very resilient and everyone could have confidence in it,Ó he said speaking at the lessor panel at MRO Asia in Singapore on Nov. 7. Despite GECASÕs enthusiasm for blockchain, Creaven says the current systems in place for digital records perform their functions effectively. Creaven says GECAS is open to participating in developing blockchain strategies through the Aviation Working Group coalition of manufacturers, leasing companies and financial institutions to ensure a combined approach from lessors. However, on the wider topic of digital records, he believes North America and Europe are some way ahead of regions such as China and India in accepting them.ÒIf thereÕs a big market that is reluctant to accept digital records then the lessors will hesitate because we need certainty that we can move our assets,"" he says. Chris Gruener, EVP head of technical at Singapore-based lessor BOC Aviation, feels blockchain is a good concept in theory. ÒItÕs great for components to have a history in this general ledger enabling someone to see things back to birth,Ó he says. ÒHowever, I donÕt think it makes a lot of sense for one player to start the blockchain while other players donÕt participate in it. If there is one transaction in the blockchain, and another outside, then the authorities wonÕt be accepting of it.Ó Gruener believes more transparency is also required to enable visibility around functions performed by every participant in the chain for individual parts. To do this, Òthe privacy element of the blockchain would have to be removed to a certain extent,Ó he says.

EEWeb,Are you ready for CES 2019?,https://www.eeweb.com/profile/max-maxfield/articles/are-you-ready-for-ces-2019,"Are You Ready for CES 2019? By Max Maxfield (Contributed Content) | Monday, December 03, 2018 2 SHARES Based on there research and interactions with industry clients, the guys and gals at Accenture have identified five ÒStories to WatchÓ at CES 2019 Do you know, out of all of the conferences and events that IÕve been fortunate enough to attend and (oftentimes) present at, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is inexplicably not amongst their number? This is all the more surprising because this event, which showcases the latest and greatest in innovative and breakthrough technologies, is just the sort of thing I love. ADVERTISING CES 2019 will focus on innovative technologies Ñ such as 5G, immersive reality, and digital trust Ñ that provide the ultimate in personalization and end-user experience, enabling a connected ecosystem across smart cities, smart homes, and in-vehicle technology. The reason why I mention this here is that IÕm currently receiving lots of emails from folks with suggestions about stories and technologies to watch out for at CES 2019, ranging from 5G to immersive reality to autonomous vehicles. For example, based on their research and interactions with industry clients, the guys and gals at Accenture have identified five ÒStories to WatchÓ at CES 2019. A summary of these stories, as described by Accenture, is as follows: 1. 5G connecting everything CES will showcase the next stage in 5G this year with a tangible look at the benefits of this technology to industries around the world, the proliferation of devices that are gathering data anywhere and everywhere, and what this means for both businesses and the end user. 5G is a key requirement for fully enabling technologies such as autonomous vehicles and the continuing development of smart cities and IoT connecting everything. While expansion of connected homes will increase, consumers will take different routes to personalize their own connected homes, influencing platforms and usage across markets. Concerns on how their data is used will need to be addressed and will impact brand loyalty when choosing which products are best and allow consumers to feel safe and comfortable in a truly connected home. Now all eyes are on the telecommunications market, and the U.S. already has major cities (Houston, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Indianapolis, to name a few) where 5G now exists in home internet. The race is on at full speed, with wireless providers Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T announcing their intentions to form full-on 5G networks across the U.S. Most mobile manufacturers claim that they will release their much-anticipated 5G phones in early 2019, when consumers can expect best-in-class wireless service with speeds never imagined before. The story will be who will get to the finish line first without any painful end-user experiences. 2. AR, VR, and XR: Immersive reality goes mainstream Immersive technology will impact how content producers, brand marketers, and a wide variety of industries go to market. The VR story: Consumers are bringing VR into their homes at lightning speed as they engage in the experiential side of what VR offers and continue to become more educated on its benefits. This yearÕs story to watch will include the competitive race to manufacture standalone headsets with a new form factor more conducive to the end user in efforts to attract audiences that are slow to adapt to VR. To date, there are 7 million VR headsets in U.S. households, still only 6% of the U.S. homes but a 25% increase from 2017 to 2018. VR has impacted nearly every industry, allowing the end user to immerse in thousands of experiences in the music, fashion, and entertainment industries. The AR story: Phones and tablets are not the only venue for this technology, as PokŽmon Go launched this technology to the masses with its experiential competitive game. The goal of AR is to create a convenient and natural immersion, with discussion topics at CES focusing on rumors of the disappearance of phones and tablets with the continuing enhancement of AR technology while still addressing political and ethical issues around privacy concerns as more consumers adapt AR into their lives. CES will provide experiences in AR/VR in every industry and every way imaginable, bringing people to places that they have never been to and bringing products into their world like never before. Extended reality: Gaming and entertainment have seen the most use with extended reality to date. However, use of wearable XR devices and supporting mobile applications will expand in all aspects of lifestyle including theme parks, resorts/hospitality, and continuing education. XR has been defined as the combined environments of both AR & VR with enhanced immersive technologies, or the merging of the physical and virtual world that will change that the way we live, work, and play. Consumers already immersed in the benefits of XR will be open to adopting in other areas of their lives. XR will organically produce benefits to consumers in additional industries like health care, with many medical experts immersed in how XR can enhance patient care for many generations and ailments. 3. Digital trust at the fore Digital trust will be a priority topic at CES 2019. As more homes become connected and people become increasingly reliant on always-listening digital voice assistants (DVAs) and the services that they provide (medical advice, financial management etc.), the use of data and digital trust comes ever more to the fore. Overall, consumers have become more cautious and tougher on the ethics of businesses and their data privacy and security practices Ñ consumers will continue to expect more control over who has access to their location and other private data. Related to this is the increasing use of blockchain technology in the media sector, continuing to solve challenges with consumer data sharing and digital rights management with a hyper-focus on what is accessible and what is private. By early 2019, over half of all media companies will be using or working on strategies to implement blockchain technology. Increasing concerns about data breaches are forcing many in the digital media ecosystem to implement blockchain technology, which will, in turn, enable them to maintain ownership and control of valuable data. Blockchain has been considered the ultimate revolutionary solution to mounting ad tech fees and hours spent reconciling post-campaign reporting for payments, helping the industry to see more tangible ROI, which encourages advertisers to spend more in 2019 and beyond. 4. Voice-enabled devices & Alexa As the popularity of Amazon Echo smart speakers increases, more brands and companies are releasing products with digital voice assistants. Most home appliances, including smart TVs, will all have voice-enabled technology, showcased at CES as a part of the smart home. Televisions and streaming devices will connect with Blu-ray players with audio-controls to help enhance the end-user cinematic experience. CES will include new and improved voice-enabled products that are more affordable and realistic for consumers, with nearly every kitchen-related appliance to include voice command. Additional home gadgets showcased at CES 2019 include voice-activated smart mirrors, showers, and lighting to help personalize home bathrooms for any guest; plugs; chargers; light switches; and virtually anything electronic. As more companies jump on the voice-command bandwagon, there will soon be more voice-activated gadgets inside and outside of the home (in-vehicle and in public areas) versus non-voice-command gadgets and products. As Alexa makes its way into every device possible, the biggest challenge and concern will be around which devices make the most sense for voice activation and which are better off left alone. 5. Self-driving cars and in-vehicle technology innovations Virtual assistants, voice commands, and connected cars as extensions of our Òsmart homesÓ Ñ these new Òinner qualitiesÓ will become much more important as new connectivity tech makes its way into our vehicles and, finally, turns them into the much-heralded Òthird place.Ó We fully expect a new range of solutions for this at this yearÕs CES, along with serious efforts to create truly personalized car experiences through AI and other solutions, which will enable cars to learn Ñ and react to Ñ driverÕs preferences. Another big theme to watch: Òsmart mobilityÓ Ñ or how cars will become an integral part of the intermodal mobility system currently in the making. New solutions will make car sharing, ride hailing, and Òmulti-mode mobilityÓ even more convenient, cost-efficient, and sustainable. And yes: The race for Òfully autonomousÓ vehicles might enter the next stage this year. Some of the related key technologies that youÕll see at CES this year include: enhanced light detection and ranging (LiDAR); camera- and image-recognition solutions for self-driving vehicles; and training data storage, management, tagging, and retrieval solutions Ñ many of which will come not from established players but from startups and non-automotive players. Another enabling technology for self-driving cars Ñ 5G Ñ will also play a key role at the show, with network providers and telcos gearing up for the rollout of the high-speed standard. Other key Òin-vehicleÓ tech stories that weÕre expecting include solutions for the up-and-coming e-mobility-revolution thatÕs expected to hit the markets this year, including battery charging and management.
